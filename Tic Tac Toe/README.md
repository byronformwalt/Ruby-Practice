Tic Tac Toe
===========================

This project was submitted as an entry to the [Tic Tac Toe Classic Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tic-tac-toe) under my handle _byronformwalt_.

The project consists of two components--a decision agent and a game simulator.  The game simulator uses the same agent to play both sides.  Details on the input and output format can be found [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tic-tac-toe).
