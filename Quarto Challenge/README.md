Quarto Challenge: 
====
April 2014 Gamathon @ hackerrank.com
=================================================

Beginning April 18, I will be participating in a 9-day challenge to competitively code a 
bot to play the classic game of quarto.  [Here](http://www.lutanho.net/play/quarto.html) is an online 2 or 1-player implementation 
of quarto I am using to develop my strategy, as I have never played this game before.

Quarto basically boils down to this: There are 16 unique game pieces, each with 4 binary
properties of physical appearance.  There is a 4x4 grid on which the game is played.
Your opponent decides which piece you have to play during each turn, and vice versa.
The first person to place a piece on the board in a manner that connects four pieces 
with at least one property in common is declared the winner.  The four pieces may be 
arranged vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

Basically, this game is a combination of Uno and Connect Four.

I will begin writing my solution tomorrow morning at 1030 MDT when the competition 
officially begins.
